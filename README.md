on the basis of their academic records.
● Implemented data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis , visualization , data preprocessing and
modelling(classification and regression).
● Used different techniques of feature importance.
● Used several important machine learning algorithms viz., k-Nearest Neighbors,Support Vector
Machines,Naive Bayes classifier,Decision Tree,Random Forest,Perceptron and Logistic Regression for
classification task and got highest accuracy score 85.71% and corresponding AUC value 0.951 by Naive
Bayes classifier.
● For the regression task , XGboost regressor which is an implementation of gradient boosting algorithm was
implemented with Mean Absolute Error 30170.77.
 Tech Stack : Several python packages like numpy,pandas,scipy,seaborn,
Matplotlib, plotly, sklearn, xgboost etc were used in Google Colab.
